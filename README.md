# Multilayer Network Embedding of PPI Networks

Understanding the intricate relationships in biological systems is crucial for advancing computational biology and medical research. This study focuses on analyzing Networks of Networks (NoN) of Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) and Protein-DNA interactions using multi-layer network embedding techniques. Leveraging data from databases such as BioGRID, STRING, and DNAproDB, we constructed a comprehensive, multi-layered biological interaction network, with a focus on two critical proteins, PTEN and CTCF, which are known for their roles in cancer and chromatin organization. The proposed Multi-layer Network Embedding (MANE) algorithm captures intra- and inter-layer dependencies, integrating structural and functional properties into a compact representation. Experimental results highlight MANE's effectiveness in tasks like link prediction and ranking biologically significant nodes. By enabling deeper insights into cross-layer dependencies, MANE advances the understanding of complex biological interactions, paving the way for novel therapeutic targets and enhanced disease modeling.
